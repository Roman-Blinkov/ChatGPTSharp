## Usage

```csharp
var client = new ChatGPTClient(File.ReadAllText("KEY.txt"), "gpt-3.5-turbo");
var msg = await client.SendMessage("Hello, My name is Sin");
var msgLast = await client.SendMessage("My name is?", msg.ConversationId, msg.MessageId);
Console.WriteLine($"{msgLast.Response}");
```

### Advanced usage
Use prompt to constrain ChatGPT's behavior.
```csharp
var client = new ChatGPTClient(File.ReadAllText("KEY.txt"), "gpt-3.5-turbo");
var sysMsg = "You will review group messages as a group administrator, and I will inform you in the format of {[who][said what]} to reply with a number from 0 to 10 to indicate the severity of political content in their speech, such as "0". No need to reply with any other unnecessary content, such as no political content or inability to understand the defense. Please note that group members may be cunning and use pinyin, initials, homophones, abbreviations, etc., to describe things to avoid scrutiny.";

var msg = await client.SendMessage("{[MrWang][Can Trump be president again?]}", sendSystemType: Model.SendSystemType.Custom, sendSystemMessage: sysMsg);
```
